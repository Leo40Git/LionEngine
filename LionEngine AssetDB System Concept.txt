LionEngine AssetDB System Concept

chunks/*.lac:
Chunk files, contain data for every asset of a specific group.
Each asset group has a seperate chunk file. A group's chunk file has the same name as the group.
Assets specify the offset to their data in the chunk file.
NOTE: Contains no padding in between asset data.

assets.lad:
The Asset DataBase file itself.
STRUCTURES:
	File Header:
	4 bytes - Magic string ("ASST") to identify LAD file
	4 bytes - Total number of groups in file
	Asset Group Header:
	32 bytes - Group name
	4 bytes - Total number of asset entries in group
	Asset Entry:
	32 bytes - Asset name
	4 bytes - Offset in chunk file
	4 bytes - Compressed size (or 0 if asset is uncompressed)
	4 bytes - Uncompressed size (or size if asset is uncompressed)
The file starts off with the File Header.
Directly after the File Header, the first asset group is defined.
Every asset group starts with the Asset Group Header, then the Asset Entries of the group are defined.
